Using the Neural Engineering Framework with Python
==================================================

This package contains an API for creating neural simulations
using the methods of the Neural Engineering Framework
(NEF_).

It also contains, at the moment, the beginnings of
a Theano_ implementation of the NEF API.

Documentation can be found at https://nef-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
